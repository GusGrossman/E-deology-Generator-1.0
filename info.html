			<p class="info">
				21 years ago, in 2001, the website https://www.politicalcompass.org/ was published. The site asks users to respond to 62 questions in order to rate their political ideology on a two axes grid which is divided by economic (right-left) and social (authoritarian-libertarian). In a 2019 report, artist Joshua Citerella noted that the political compass site can be viewed as a precursor to “e-deologies, radical politics as a form of niche personal branding.”. E-deologies encourage a playful (but often sinister) form of politicking in which people become radicalized online via memes, message boards, and tiktok/youtube. While one can argue that E-deologies makes obscure political theory more accessible to the masses, one could counter that it can be extremely counteriniute and divisive to many political movements from the “dirtbag-left” to the alt-right. Some political ideologies that are a trademark of “E-deologies” is the Uber reactionary, anarcho-primitivism, a political theory that advocates for a return to “non-civilized” ways of life through deindustrialization and the “Brogressive” Fully Automated Luxury Communism which argues that through a full embrace of sophisticated technologies, society would be free from inequality, and enter a utopia where work is obsolete and there is universal basic income/housing for all. This project/game seeks to explore several E-deologies such as Post-Fordism, Neo-Conservativsm, Anarcho-Primitivism, Fully Automated Luxury Communism, Right Libertarianism, and Trans-Humanism through role playing. Through this gamification of political discourse, I want to make students who aren’t familiar with theory understand the playful nature of (theory) that allows readers to (as design collective, Experimental Jetset put it) “make strings of associations that seem totally impossible, and arrive at conclusions that are almost otherworldly.”  <br><br><br>
